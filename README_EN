#Userdata class

This client uses encapsulation to store and obtain user information which are stored in objects shared accross threads, which are $logindata (which stores the initial configuration of login values and is untouched across the program) and $userdata (where are stored all the user data, included your own).

It is not recommended to modify directly logindata values as they could not be used to revert to the original login data.

Userdata class API:

In the case you are retrieving your own login data with $logindata, it is not neccesary to provide an ID to get functions.

* set_name(NAME, ID) / get_name(ID) :<br>
Takes a NAME and ID as arguments and returns a scalar containing name.
* set_id(ID) / get_id(ID):<br>
Takes an ID as argument and returns a scalar containing login ID.
* set_character(CHARACTER, ID) / get_character(ID):<br>
Takes a CHARACTER and ID as arguments and returns a scalar containing character.
* set_status(STATUS, ID) / get_status(ID) :<br>
Takes a STATUS and ID as arguments and returns a scalar containing status.
* set_trip(TRIP, ID) / get_trip(ID) :<br>
Takes a TRIP as argument and returns a scalar containing trip.
* set_ihash(IHASH, ID) / get_ihash(ID) :<br>
Takes an IHASH and ID as arguments and returns a scalar containing ihash.
* set_r(R, ID) / get_r(ID) :<br>
Takes red (R) and ID as arguments and returns a scalar containing the red color.
* set_g(G, ID) / get_g(ID) :<br>
Takes green (G) and ID as arguments and returns a scalar containing the green color.
* set_b(B, ID) / get_b(ID) :<br>
Takes blue (B) and ID as arguments and returns a scalar containing the blue color.
